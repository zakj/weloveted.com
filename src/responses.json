A year later, there's still a lot to learn and it can still be intimidating, but Ted has always been someone I could rely on for help. I try not to bug him too much when I have other options, but knowing he is someone I can reach out to about pretty much anything is comforting. And though he may have birthed the \"read code\" mantra, he has never turned me away when I had a question. Also, he shares Ariadne with us. ❤️"}
